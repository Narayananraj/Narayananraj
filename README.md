                                                         Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Narayanan Rajendiran


I am passionate about solving complex problems through innovative DevOps practices and cloud-native solutions. With a solid background in deploying scalable, automated systems, I specialize in CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, AWS Cloud, and containerization. My work is focused on bridging the gap between development and operations, enabling faster, more reliable delivery of software and infrastructure. ðŸŽ¯
